# Configuration Management System Development Chat History

## Initial Request
User requested to design a configuration management interface with the following requirements:
- Interface for setting/getting permanent data in key-value format
- Support for different data types (states, configurations, status data)
- Multiple access methods (CLI, C library, through sdbus requests to any services)
- Distributed storage with centralized interface
- High-performance data access
- Module-specific configuration support

## Design Evolution

### 1. First Design Discussion
- Proposed initial architecture with memory management and caching
- Discussed data structure handling
- Covered basic performance requirements
- Outlined core components and features

### 2. Cache Integration Discussion
User requested to enhance caching functionality:
- Cache management should be integrated into the interface
- Configurable caching policies
- Cache should be part of the implementation

### 3. UCI-Like Implementation
User requested to base the design on UCI (OpenWRT's Unified Configuration Interface):
- Keep UCI's simplicity and file structure
- Enhance with our additional features
- Maintain compatibility with existing systems

### 4. uthash Integration
User requested to:
- Use uthash for memory-mapped storage
- Implement fast access patterns
- Support complex data structures
- Enable efficient key-value operations

### 5. Requirements Refinement
Added additional components:
- Schema version control
- Transaction support
- Event system
- Monitoring and metrics
- Reliability requirements
